# **Welcome to My Github!!**
## I'm Nour Nahtay, a Bioinformatics Researcher with a Bachelor's Degree in Biochemistry.

### About Me:
I'm a bioinformatics researcher with a year worth of experience in genomics & transcriptomics. I am proficient in designing pipelines for preprocessing and analyzing large-scale datasets, employing advanced tools for complex data analysis. Passionate about contributing to personalized medicine research and decoding the intersectionality between environment, demographic factors and disease, disorder & infection prevalence, with interest in cancer, AMR, neurodiversity, psychiatric disorders & autoimmune diseases.

### Technical Skills:
* **Programming Languages:** R, Bash & Python
* **Omics Techniques:** WGS Analysis with Bash, Bulk RNA-Seq with R & Bash, Resistome Analysis with Bash, Variant Calling with Bash
* **Statistics Softwares:** SPSS, GraphPad Prism
* **Database:** SQL
* **Bioinformatics Tools:** SRA-toolKit, BWA, samtools, IGV, FreeBayes, viralrecon, DESeq2, TCGABiolinks, edgeR, rgitools, ggplot2, limma, bcftools

### Projects:
### 1. [Uncovering Therapeutic Targets and Key Biomarkers from TCGA Datasets – Biomarker Discovery Internship, HackBio](https://github.com/nournahtay/Biomarker_Discovery_Hackbio)
Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis (Differential Expression & Functional Enrichment Analyses) on TCGA datasets (glioblastoma, melanoma & glioma) to uncover biomarkers for therapeutic targetting. This work delves into the impact of demography (particularly sex) on the variation of early & late-stage biomarkers (in this case melanoma) and also verifies the status of isocitrate dehydrogenase on the progression of diffuse glioma. 

### 2. [Variant Calling & Downstream Analysis of Publicly Available SARS-CoV-2 WGS Datasets – Analyzing & Interpreting Genomics Datasets, Wellcome Connecting Science (FutureLearn)](https://github.com/nournahtay/Bioinformatics_for_Biologists_Genomic_Datasets)
End-To-End analysis for assembling, annotating, variant-calling & analyzing SARS-CoV-2 WGS data to identify & characterize mutations, their location, and possible impact on gene.


### Thank you for reaching this far!!!
